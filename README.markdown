Content
========
The content is loaded in the "content" folder in the app-root.

To add content, add an html file to the proper directory. Inside the
html file you can add div classes of:
"excerpt" which will show up as the excerpt on the home page for instance, 
"left" for the left pane content, and 
"boddy" for the full body of the message.

toooo easy.
